# Data Engineering Project: JJ Furniture

This is a data engineering project between Jon and Julian - two Data Scientist colleagues who want to learn more about the data modeling process. 
We decided to create a fake business named JJ Furniture along with creating fake data sets. 

Our goals: 
- mimic what a real Customer Analytics team does at a large corporation  
- take data from source systems, load it, create pipelines, ETL, and analytics-ready/model-ready data
- git better at git (git it)
