# Data Engineering Project: JJ Furniture

This is a data engineering project between Jon and Julian - two Data Scientist colleagues who want to learn more about the data modeling process. 
We decided to create a fake business named JJ Furniture along with creating fake data sets. 

Our goals: 
- get swole
- that's it.
